The will be the first _High Notes_! Join me for music and reflection.

_High Notes_ is about listening to music, together. Each person attending chooses a song to share with the group, and we use the resulting playlist as a centerpiece for silent meditation. Cannabis is encouraged, though not required, for enhancing the listening experience.

## “Choosing a song is a lot of pressure!”
{: .subheading-5 }

The song you choose is for _you_. Pick a song that makes you feel good, one that recalls a good memory, or one that calms you down. We won't share who chose which song, so don't worry about impressing people with your music tastes.

## “What should I bring? What should I wear?”
{: .subheading-5 }

Wear something comfortable. We'll be sitting or lying on the floor, with ample pillows and blankets. Bring some cannabis that makes you feel great. We will also have some on hand to share.
