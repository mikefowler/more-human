In high school, after buying a new record, I would lie on my bed and listen to it straight through. From the first note to the final vibrations of the secret track. I wasn't just listening to music. I was really *listening*.

Recently, I started making an effort to _actively_ listen to music. I would sit on my bed, put headphones on, and close my eyes. What I noticed was that I started hearing music differently. If I was listening to a new album, I felt the impact of it more. I would listen to an album I cherished and hear things I'd missed.

_High Notes_ is about actively listening to music, together. Each person attending chooses a song to share with the group, and we use the resulting playlist as a centerpiece for silent meditation. Cannabis is encouraged, though not required, for enhancing the listening experience.
